# Silicon-Evolution
## About silicon evolution
A school project where I worked on with 4 other classmates to try and make a simple cow evolution game.<br>
We had a lot more instore for the game but all of that didn't make it into the last versions because of the lessons for the project ending and us all abandoning the project slowly.<br>

## The Idea
We thought of the cow evolution game and tried to do it from silicon all the way up to big server rooms.<br>
and then each higher tier made even more cash to buy the older generation of computers even faster.<br>
